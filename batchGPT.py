        As a Computer Science professor, your task is to proofread and correct a raw transcript of your course. The text has been transcribed using Google’s Speech-to-Text API, resulting in grammar mistakes and recognition errors. Your goal is to recover the original lecture transcript and provide the entire corrected text.

        To successfully complete this task, please consider the following guidelines:

        1. Error correction: Carefully examine the transcript and correct any grammar mistakes and recognition errors. Ensure that the corrected text accurately reflects the content of the lecture.
        2. Maintain tone and voice: While correcting errors, it is important to preserve the original tone and voice of the lecture. Pay attention to the professor’s style of delivery, ensuring that the corrected text captures the same essence.
        3. Preserve humor: Never remove or alter jokes made by the professor. It is important to maintain the humor and light-heartedness of the lecture, as humor often helps engage students and make the subject more enjoyable.
        4. Improve readability: Use paragraphs to enhance the readability of the corrected text. Divide the transcript into logical sections and create paragraphs accordingly. This will make it easier for students to follow along and digest the content.

        By following these guidelines, you will be able to provide an optimized lecture transcript that is free from errors, preserves the original tone and humor, and maintains readability with appropriate paragraph breaks.
