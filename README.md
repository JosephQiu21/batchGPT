# batchGPT

This Python script utilizes the OpenAI API, specifically the GPT-3.5-turbo-16k model, to handle large text inputs. 

I developed this script to refine and translate the transcriptions of lectures I recorded using Googleâ€™s Speech-to-Text API. You can define your own prompt for your text processing task.

The script divides the input into smaller, manageable chunks, processes each chunk, and combines the outputs from multiple API calls.

## My Prompts
- **Refine Text**: Improve the quality of transcriptions or any large text by refining grammar, maintaining tone, preserving humor, and improving readability.
- **Translate Text**: Convert English text into Chinese, providing high-quality, fluent translations with an emphasis on simplicity and clarity.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `nltk` library (`pip install nltk`)
- OpenAI Python client (`pip install openai`)

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repository.

2. Download the required NLTK tokenizer:
   ```
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key. Never hardcode this key in your scripts. Instead, set it as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
   ```

## Usage

```
python batchGPT.py <path_to_input_file> [refine/translate]
```
- `<path_to_input_file>`: Path to the file containing the text you want to refine or translate.
- `refine`: For refining and improving the quality of the text.
- `translate`: For translating the text from English to Chinese.

For example:
```
python batchGPT.py myLectureTranscription.txt refine
```

## Customizing the Prompt

The prompts provided for refining and translating are generic. If you're working with a specific domain or need more customized results, you're encouraged to modify the `system_text` within the script. Create prompts that guide the model to deliver results in the manner you desire.
